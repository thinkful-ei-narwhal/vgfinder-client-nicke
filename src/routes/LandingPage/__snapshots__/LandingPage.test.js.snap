    Hello, and welcome to VGFinder!
  </h1>
  <p>
    In an industry dominated by the triple A video games, it's easy to miss out on titles that do not have a multi-million dollar marketing budget. That's why I made this site, to help small video game studios and solo developers get the exposure that their games deserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site recommends new indie game titles and lets users make a wishlist of their favorite games. If your are an indie game enthusiast yourself and know of a game that isn't in the database, feel free to contribute and help other gamers finder their new favorite game.
